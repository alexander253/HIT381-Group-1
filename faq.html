    <h3>How much sleep should I get at night?</h3>
    <p>The average sleep an adult requires or might expect to sleep is around eight hours a night.
      However there is no ‘normal’ length of time, it is whatever is natural for you. We all feel
       tired at times but it is important that it is not disruptive to your daily life and general health.</p>

       <p>Looking at your bedroom environment and video and then assessing if there is anything you can do to
       improve your quality of your environment might help you to improve on the time you are asleep.</p>

      <h3>How can I make sure I am getting a proper night's sleep every night?</h3>
      <p>To ensure you experience good sleep it’s essential to follow good lifestyle habits and to eliminate
         the factors that are causing you disturbed sleep. </p>

        <p> For example making sure that your bedroom is the
         right environment (cool, dark and quiet), that your bed is up to scratch, looking at the lighting in
         your home, and avoiding foods and drinks that can hinder sleep. Avoid screen time at least an hour before
         bed and find alternative ways of relaxing like warm baths with calming scents, quiet soothing music, reading,
         gentle stretching and yoga. </p>

         <p>It’s also important to establish regular sleep pattern – going to bed and waking up
         at roughly the same time. Your bodies and minds will feel much better for it.</p>

      <h3>I struggle to fall asleep, what can I do?</h3>
      <p>Practise some deep breathing techniques. Spend five minutes indulging in pure relaxation and allow
        yourself to sink into a sound fulfilling sleep. If your mind is buzzing with things to do, write them down.</p>

         <p>Don’t try to sleep – it needs to find you. Keep your eyes open and gently resist sleep or try to adopt a carefree,
          accepting attitude to wakefulness. </p>

          <p>Avoid clock watching if you can’t get to sleep within 15 minutes from switching
          light off then get up and go to another room and doing something relaxing.</p>
